Mia-Chat Installation Notes:

1) Create a new database and database user for Mia
2) Make sure the new database user has the permissions needed to create and manage the database
3) Run the SQL statements contained in the mia.sql file against your MySQL database (if you are 
    not using MySQL find more information below)
4) Create a Mia-Chat configuration file called config.ini.php in the root of your Mia-Chat installation.  Use
    the included config.ini.sample.php file as your guide.
5) After setting up the configuration file make sure it is no longer writeable by the server (ex) chmod 444 config.ini.php
6) Remove the installation folder from your server
7) Mia-Chat uses HTMLPurifier (http://htmlpurifier.org) to help with input filtering and security issues like xss 
    attacks, etc.  HTMLPurifier uses caching an its cache folder needs special permission to function properly.  Below
    you will find the documentation on setting this up.

	Caching:
	HTML Purifier generates some cache files (generally one or two) to speed up
	its execution. For maximum performance, make sure that
	includes/htmlpurifier/HTMLPurifier/DefinitionCache/Serializer is writeable by the webserver.

	If you are in the library/ folder of HTML Purifier, you can set the
	appropriate permissions using:

	    chmod -R 0755 includes/htmlpurifier/HTMLPurifier/DefinitionCache/Serializer

	If the above command doesn't work, you may need to assign write permissions
	to all. This may be necessary if your webserver runs as nobody, but is
	not recommended since it means any other user can write files in the
	directory. Use:

	    chmod -R 0777 includes/htmlpurifier/HTMLPurifier/DefinitionCache/Serializer

	You can also chmod files via your FTP client; this option
	is usually accessible by right clicking the corresponding directory and
	then selecting "chmod" or "file permissions".

	Starting with 2.0.1, HTML Purifier will generate friendly error messages
	that will tell you exactly what you have to chmod the directory to, if in doubt,
	follow its advice.

	If you are unable or unwilling to give write permissions to the cache
	directory, you can either disable the cache (and suffer a performance
	hit):

	    $config->set('Core', 'DefinitionCache', null);

	Or move the cache directory somewhere else (no trailing slash):

	    $config->set('Cache', 'SerializerPath', '/home/user/absolute/path');
	    
8) That's it.  Browse to http://path_to_mia/index.php.  Enjoy :)

Wait, what about non-MySQL databases?

Mia-Chat includes the SQL file needed to create the proper MySQL database. However, Mia-Chat has been built with database portability 
in mind. See the new automated installer for other options.
