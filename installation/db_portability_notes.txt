# DEFAULT DATE values (0000-00-00 doesn't work in many DBs, Out of Range error)
# Use type="I" in place of the better boolean type="L" (Postgres doesn't like)
# Oracle doesn't like the use of column names 'ordering', 'access', and 'count'.  
# Don't name the indexes and tables the sames (Postgres doesn't like)
# Oracle has a 30 char limit on length of object names
